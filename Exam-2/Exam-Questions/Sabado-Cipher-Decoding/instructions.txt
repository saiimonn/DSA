Background:

 

Janie is going back to Davao for All Soul's day and her boyfriend is there to pick her up from the airport. Her boyfriend asked if there is anything she would want as a gift when she arrives and she replies with an encoded message. This encoded message is a series of 4 integer values that can be converted into an 8 letter word. It is now up to you to make sure that Janie's boyfriend will get her the correct gift for when she arrives.

 
Objective:

 

Create the three functions that is necessary in decoding the message in the file decode.c

    int* bitmaskToArray(short int word[]) - this function takes the array of integers and returns a a bit vector array
    char* decodeString(int arr[]) - this function takes the bit vector array and returns the 8 letter string
    void displayBitPattern(int arr[]) - this function displays the bit pattern of the bit vector array

 
Notes:

    Remember to terminate the end of the string with \0
    Bit vector array is where each index of the array represents a boolean value: 0 or 1
    Remember one character is 8 bits, given a binary 01011001 is 89 in decimal, it represents the character 'Y'

 
Decoding Guide:

 

Given the short integer value 22863, it is represented in bits as 0101100101001111. Those bits are then stored in a bit vector array and then converted to represent 2 letters.

 

short int val = 22863

bit representation: 0101100101001111
           letters: YO
