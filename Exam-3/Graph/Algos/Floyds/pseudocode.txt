Pseudocode for Floyd-Warshalls Algorithm

Parameter/s: Matrix/List
Return type: 2D Array

1. Create a 2D array D[MAX][MAX]
2. For i = 0 to MAX-1:
       For j = 0 to MAX-1:
            D[i][j] = M[i][j]
3. For i = 0 to MAX-1:
       D[i][i] = 0
4. For k = 0 to MAX-1:
       For i = 0 to MAX-1:
            For j = 0 to MAX-1:
                 w = D[i][k] + D[k][j]
                 If w < D[i][j]:
                      D[i][j] = w
5. Return D
