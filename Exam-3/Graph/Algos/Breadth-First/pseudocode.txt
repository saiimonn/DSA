Pseudocode for Breadth-First Search traversal (using Queue)

BFS(Graph, root):

1. Initialize visited[] = FALSE for all vertices
2. Initialize an empty Queue
3. Mark root as visited
4. Enqueue(root)
5. While Queue is NOT empty:
       current = Dequeue()
       Print current
       For v from 0 to MAX-1:
            If v is adjacent to current AND visited[v] is FALSE:
                 Mark visited[v] = TRUE
                 Enqueue(v)
