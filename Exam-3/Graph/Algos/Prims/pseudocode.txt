Pseudocode for Prim's Algorithm

parameters: (Adjacency Matrix/List, source vertex)
return type: Minimum Spanning Tree

1. Initialize MST:
    spanTree.edgeCount = 0
    spanTree.totalWgt = 0
2. Initialize visited set:
    visited[0..n-1] = 0
    visited[source] = 1
3. Define number of edges to include:
    numEdges = n - 1
4. While spanTree.edgeCount < numEdges AND spanTree.totalWgt < INF:  
    a. Initialize minEdge:
        minEdge.weight = INF
        minEdge.tail = -1
        minEdge.head = -1
    b. For each node i in 0..n-1:
        If visited[i] == 1:  // i is already in MST
            For each node j in 0..n-1:
                If visited[j] == 0 AND M[i][j] < minEdge.weight:
                    minEdge.tail = i
                    minEdge.head = j
                    minEdge.weight = M[i][j]
    c. If minEdge.weight != INF:
        - Add minEdge to spanTree.edges
        - spanTree.edgeCount += 1
        - spanTree.totalWgt += minEdge.weight
        - visited[minEdge.head] = 1  
    Else:
        Break   
5. Return spanTree
