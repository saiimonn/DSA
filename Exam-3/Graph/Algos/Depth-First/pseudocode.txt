Pseudocode for Depth-First Search Traversal (Recursion)

DFS(Graph, vertex):
1. Mark vertex as visited
2. Print vertex
3. For each v from 0 to MAX-1:
       If v is adjacent to vertex AND visited[v] is FALSE:
            Call DFS(Graph, v)

Pseudocode for Depth-First Search Traversal (Stack)

DFS_Stack(Graph, source):

1. Initialize visited[] = FALSE for all vertices
2. Initialize an empty Stack
3. Push source onto the Stack
4. While Stack is NOT empty:
       current = Pop(Stack)
       If visited[current] is FALSE:
            Mark current as visited
            Print current
            For v from MAX-1 down to 0:
                If v is adjacent to current AND visited[v] is FALSE:
                     Push v onto the Stack
